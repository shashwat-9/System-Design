# Introduction
This section covers two topics
1. Guiding Principles
 - Discussion around S.O.L.I.D principle, Composition, Inheritance, Encapsulation
 - Guiding Principles are data driven experience for best practices.
2. Design Patterns
 - Multiple design patterns will be discussed.
 - A set of solutions for various problems.

## The need for good coding practices
 - Low Level design is basically coding + designing of the components
 - Google defines a good practice as coding across time, where the future engineer will be at ease in implementing it further.

There are three major principles for good coding practice 
1. Readability -> The code should be readable and workable with
2. Extensibility -> Adding a new feature over an existing codebase is easy and doesn't require the existing codebase to 
change.
3. Correctness -> Self-explanatory

### API and Package Structuring
 - APIs are endpoints that other developers use to interact with your system.
 - For our purpose, the method signature, which consists of name of the method, arguments, exception it throws and the 
object it returns can be called as APIs.
 - There is no other way to interact with a system except APIs.

The agenda is to write not just correct code, but also that continues to work for different scenarios in future.
